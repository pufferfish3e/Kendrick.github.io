            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Kendrick, a student with a passion for coding! I have been interested in coding for quite a while now and have participated in various courses on YouTube. I am quite proficient in Python and am currently learning C++ through an official course on Udemy. I have also participated in a hackathon called "Lag n Crash," which allowed me to gain more insight into the field. I am a curious student who always wants to know why things work, and I will not stop until I have an answer that satisfies me.
               
               Thank you for taking the time to visit and read my portfolio. I invite you to explore my projects and achievements to get a better sense of my work and dedication. If you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me! I am always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and professionals in the field of coding!

                <h3>Password Generator with GUI</h3>
                <p>This project was made when I found inspiration from previous password generator projects that I found. Looking at most of them, I realised that most of them did not have a GUI, and that I coulld give it a try as this was one of my first "actual projects". While the GUI on this project does look a little off, I am glad that I learnt how to use and work with python GUIs to create functional scripts which have a user interface, particularly with the SimplePyGUI module.</p>

                <h3>Powerpoint Slide Generator</h3>
                <p>This project was created together with my friend as we realized that we could automate the process of generating slides using the PowerPoint module ported into Python. The main function of the project was to eliminate the repetitive task of recreating the same set of PowerPoint slides every single week for our Bible study sessions when most of the slide content was the same. We modified the generator to include the ability to generate slides based on three song numbers, which are retrieved from the internal database. This project allowed me to learn how to use the PowerPoint module in Python, as well as how to store, manage, and retrieve data from a "database"—in this case, a YAML file that contained all the stored songs. Lastly, to enable our entire community to use it without any prior coding knowledge, we ported the project to Google Colab with user-friendly instructions on how to set everything up and obtain the generated slides in less than a minute.</p>
