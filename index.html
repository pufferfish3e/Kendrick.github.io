            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm Kendrick, a student with a passion for coding! I have been interested in coding for quite a while now and have participated in various courses on YouTube. I am quite proficient in Python and am currently learning C++ through an official course on Udemy. I have also participated in a hackathon called "Lag n Crash," which allowed me to gain more insight into the field. I am a curious student who always wants to know why things work, and I will not stop until I have an answer that satisfies me.
               
               Thank you for taking the time to visit and read my portfolio. I invite you to explore my projects and achievements to get a better sense of my work and dedication. If you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me! I am always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and professionals in the field of coding!

                <h3>Password Generator with GUI</h3>
                <p>This project is a simple password generator with an added graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user interaction. Inspired by existing password generator projects, I noticed that many lacked a GUI, so I decided to take on the challenge of creating one. This was one of my first significant projects, and although the GUI might appear somewhat rudimentary, I am proud of what I achieved.

                   One of the primary challenges was my limited knowledge of the SimplePyGUI module. To overcome this, I dedicated time to practicing and thoroughly reading the documentation. This effort paid off as I learned how to effectively use GUIs in Python to create functional scripts with user interfaces. Additionally, I gained experience in accessing and processing data from user inputs.

                   This project not only helped me develop my skills in Python GUIs but also served as a crucial stepping stone in my journey into Python programming..</p>

                <h3>Powerpoint Slide Generator</h3>
                <p>This project was created together with my friend as we realized that we could automate the process of generating slides using the PowerPoint module ported into Python. The main function of the project was to eliminate the repetitive task of recreating the same set of PowerPoint slides every single week for our Bible study sessions when most of the slide content was the same. We modified the generator to include the ability to generate slides based on three song numbers, which are retrieved from the internal database. This project allowed me to learn how to use the PowerPoint module in Python, as well as how to store, manage, and retrieve data from a "database"—in this case, a YAML file that contained all the stored songs. Lastly, to enable our entire community to use it without any prior coding knowledge, we ported the project to Google Colab with user-friendly instructions on how to set everything up and obtain the generated slides in less than a minute.</p>

           <ul>
              <li>My class and I went to Gan Eng Seng Primary School and conducted interactive storytelling sessions, along with activity books for the lower primary students.</li>
              <li>Most of the kids were excited and fun to work with, and we had to explain things slowly to help them complete the task.</li>
              <li>Through the VIA experience, I have learned that children require careful attention, and we should acknowledge the hard work of our parents and teachers in nurturing us into who we are today.</li>

              <li>Both activities were really tiring but fruitful. We spent time engaging with the seniors, allowing them to visit booths, play games, and win prizes. My classmates and I also performed for the seniors.</li>
              <li>Through these experiences, I came to appreciate the cleanliness of my surroundings and gained insight into how tiring it is to plan an entire event of fun and games for the seniors.</li>

            <h2>Talents and Interests</h2>
            <h3 class="textcolor">Sports and Recreation</h3>
            <h4>Badminton</h4>
            <p>I’ve had a passion for badminton since I was young, and it’s been a major part of my life ever since. I was initially introduced to the sport by my father, and since then, I haven’t stopped playing. I participated in the national school games during my primary school years, which further fueled my enthusiasm for the game. Beyond its physical demands, badminton has taught me valuable lessons in dedication and sportsmanship. It’s not merely a hobby but a defining aspect of my identity. I continue to derive joy from playing and refining my skills, always eager for the next challenge on the court.</p>
           <h3 class="textcolor">Performing Arts</h3>
           <h4>Piano</h4>
           <p>I started playing the piano at a very young age, inspired by my mother, a passionate piano teacher who provided constant support and love. Throughout my primary school years, I immersed myself in piano playing, guided by her expertise. However, around the age of twelve, due to time constraints, I had to take a break from regular practice, and since then, my piano playing has become infrequent. Despite this, the skills I acquired have greatly enriched my life. They have enhanced my hand-eye coordination, deepened my ability to read and interpret music, and taught me about the nuanced flows and articulations of music, skills that extend beyond piano playing and apply to other forms of performing arts.</p>
           <h4>Singing</h4>
           <p>I started singing in the church choir at a young age, thanks to my mom’s encouragement to join. Ever since then, I’ve been actively involved in our monthly performances, attending weekly practice sessions consistently. Alongside the church choir, I also joined an external choir, where we perform in concert halls for larger audiences at a more professional level. These experiences have greatly enriched my musical exposure and strengthened my foundation in music.</p>
           <h4>Saxophone</h4>
           <p>I discovered the saxophone through my school's CCA program, captivated by its soulful sound and expressive potential. As I began playing, I was immediately struck by its versatility in conveying emotions through music. With a solid foundation in music theory, practicing and mastering the instrument felt natural and enjoyable rather than daunting. This approach allowed me to explore a wide range of musical genres, including jazz and pop, alongside the classical pieces typically practiced. Beyond merely playing notes, the saxophone has become a means for me to connect deeply with audiences, weaving narratives and expressing myself creatively through music.</p>
