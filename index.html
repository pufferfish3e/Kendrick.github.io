            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm [Your Name], a student with a passion for coding! I have been interested in coding for quite a while now and have participated in various courses on YouTube. I am quite proficient in Python and am currently learning C++ through an official course on Udemy. I have also participated in a hackathon called "Lag n Crash," which allowed me to gain more insight into the field. I am a curious student who always wants to know why things work, and I will not stop until I have an answer that satisfies me.
               Thank you for taking the time to visit and read my portfolio. I invite you to explore my projects and achievements to get a better sense of my work and dedication. If you have any questions or opportunities for collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me! I am always eager to connect with fellow enthusiasts and professionals in the field of coding!

                <h3>Password Generator with GUI</h3>
                <p>This project was made when I found inspiration from previous password generator projects that I found. Looking at most of them, I realised that most of them did not have a GUI, and that I coulld give it a try as this was one of my first "actual projects". While the GUI on this project does look a little off, I am glad that I learnt how to use and work with python GUIs, particularly SimplePyGUI.</p>
